# tables_io

`tables_io` provides an interface for a variety of non-ASCII file formats that are commonly used within the [LSST DESC collaboration](https://lsstdesc.org/). It allows users to read in data from multiple types of files through one convenient interface.

See [read the docs](https://tables-io.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for documentation.

## Features:

- reads and writes files that contain one or more data tables
- supports a variety of file types (`fits`, `hdf5`, `parquet`) and tabular formats (`astropy`, `pandas`, `pyarrow`, `numpy`)
- allows easy conversions between file formats and in memory tabular formats
- ability to do chunked reads and writes of `HDF5` and `parquet` files

`tables_io` is currently being used in the following packages:

    * [`qp`](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/qp)
    * [`RAIL`](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/rail)
