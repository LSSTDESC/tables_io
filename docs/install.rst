Installing tables_io
====================

For now the only installation type that is support is installing from source.   Since `tables_io` is all python code, this is pretty easy.


Installing from source
-----------------------

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/LSSTDESC/tables_io.git
    cd tables_io
    python setup.py install
